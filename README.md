# Tokenized Public Infrastructure Climate Adaptation

A blockchain-based system for managing and tracking climate adaptation measures for public infrastructure using smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive framework for tokenizing public infrastructure climate adaptation through a series of interconnected smart contracts. The system enables transparent tracking, verification, and management of climate resilience improvements across public infrastructure assets.

## Architecture

The system consists of five core smart contracts:

### 1. Infrastructure Verification Contract
- **Purpose**: Validates and registers public infrastructure assets
- **Features**:
    - Asset registration and verification
    - Ownership and custody tracking
    - Infrastructure metadata management
    - Asset tokenization capabilities

### 2. Climate Risk Assessment Contract
- **Purpose**: Evaluates infrastructure vulnerabilities to climate risks
- **Features**:
    - Risk scoring algorithms
    - Vulnerability assessments
    - Climate data integration
    - Risk threshold management

### 3. Adaptation Planning Contract
- **Purpose**: Manages climate resilience improvement plans
- **Features**:
    - Adaptation strategy development
    - Resource allocation planning
    - Timeline management
    - Stakeholder coordination

### 4. Implementation Tracking Contract
- **Purpose**: Monitors progress of adaptation measures
- **Features**:
    - Milestone tracking
    - Progress reporting
    - Resource utilization monitoring
    - Quality assurance checkpoints

### 5. Performance Measurement Contract
- **Purpose**: Evaluates effectiveness of implemented adaptations
- **Features**:
    - Performance metrics collection
    - Effectiveness analysis
    - ROI calculations
    - Continuous improvement feedback

## Key Features

### Tokenization
- Infrastructure assets are tokenized for transparent ownership and value tracking
- Adaptation investments are represented as tradeable tokens
- Performance-based rewards through token mechanisms

### Transparency
- All adaptation activities recorded on-chain
- Public access to infrastructure climate data
- Immutable audit trail for compliance

### Incentive Alignment
- Token rewards for successful adaptation implementations
- Performance-based compensation models
- Community governance through token voting

### Data Integration
- Climate data feeds integration
- IoT sensor data incorporation
- Third-party verification systems
